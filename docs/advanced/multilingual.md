# Multilingual Sites

If sites publish in multiple languages and use a plugin to present a list of language versions, wpextract can parse this and add links between translated versions in the output dataset.

## Extraction Process

Extracting multilingual data is performed during the [extract command](../usage/extract.md). This data isn't available in the WordPress REST API response, so instead must be obtained from scraped HTML.

Obtaining the scraped HTML is relatively straightforward, as we already have a list of all posts from the [download command](../usage/download.md).

One way this could be scraped is using `jq` to parse the downloaded posts file and produce a URL list, then `wget` to download each page:

```shell-session
$ cat posts.json | jq -r '.[] | .link' > url_list.txt
$ touch rejected.log
$ wget --adjust-extension --input-file=url_list.txt \
     --wait 1 --random-wait --force-directories \
     --rejected-log=rejected.log
```

When running [the extract command](../usage/extract.md), pass this directory as the `--scrape-root` argument. The scrape will be crawled to match URLs to downloaded HTML files following [this process](../usage/extract.md#1-scrape-crawling-optional).


## Supported Plugins

wpextract uses an extensible system of parsers to find language picker elements and extract their data.

Currently the following plugins are supported:

### Polylang
[Plugin Page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) &middot; [Website](https://polylang.pro/)

**Supports**:

- Adding as a widget (e.g. to a sidebar)

    ??? example
        ```html
        --8<-- "tests/parse/translations/test_pickers/polylang_widget.html:struct"
        ```


- Adding to the navbar as a custom dropdown[^dropdown]

    ??? example
        ```html
        --8<-- "tests/parse/translations/test_pickers/polylang_custom_dropdown.html:struct"
        ```

**Does not support**:

- Methods which show the picker as a `<select>` element

[^dropdown]: This implementation may be overly customised to the site it was added to collect.

## Adding Support

!!! info "See also"
    To use additional pickers, you must [use WPextract as a library](library.md).

Support can be added by creating a new picker definition inheriting from [`LangPicker`][wpextract.parse.translations.LangPicker], and passing to the `translation_pickers` argument of [`WPExtractor`][wpextract.WPExtractor]

This parent class defines two abstract methods which must be implemented:

- [`LangPicker.get_root`][wpextract.parse.translations.LangPicker.get_root] - returns the root element of the picker
- [`LangPicker.extract`][wpextract.parse.translations.LangPicker.extract] - find the languages, call [`LangPicker.set_current_lang`][wpextract.parse.translations.LangPicker.set_current_lang] and call [`LangPicker.add_translation`][wpextract.parse.translations.LangPicker.add_translation] for each

More complicated pickers may need to override additional methods of the class, but should still ultimately populate the [`LangPicker.translations`][wpextract.parse.translations.LangPicker.translations] and [`LangPicker.current_language`][wpextract.parse.translations.LangPicker.current_language] attributes as the parent class does.

This section will show implementing a new picker with the following simplified markup:

```html
<ul class="translations">
  <li><a href="/page/" class="lang current-lang" lang="en">English</a></li>
  <li><a href="/de/seite/" class="lang" lang="de">Deutsch</a></li>
  <li><a href="/page/" class="lang no-translation" lang="fr">Fran√ßais</a></li>
</ul>
```
The correct parse of this picker should set the current language to English, add German as a translation, and ignore French.

### `get_root()`

Using the `self.page_doc` attribute, a [`BeautifulSoup`][bs4.BeautifulSoup] object representing the page, the root element of the picker should be found and returned.

The `select_one` method is used to find the root element, and will return `None` if no element is found, which will be intepreted as the picker not being present on the page.

If a value is returned, the `self.root_el` attribute will be populated with the result of this method.

??? example "Example `get_root` implementation"
    ```python

    class MyPicker(LangPicker):
        ...
        def get_root(self) -> Tag:
            return self.page_doc.select_one('ul', class_='translations')
    ```

### `extract()`

Using the `self.root_el` attribute, the languages should be found and added to the dataset.

Be careful to avoid:
- Adding the current language
- Adding languages which are listed but don't have translations

??? example "Example `extract` implementation"
    ```python

    class MyPicker(LangPicker):
        ...
        def extract(self):
            for lang_el in self.root_el.select('li'):
                lang_a = lang_el.select_one('a')
                if 'current-lang' in lang_a.get('class'):
                    self.set_current_lang(lang)
                elif 'no-translation' not in lang_a.get('class'):
                    self.add_translation(lang_a.get('href'), lang_a.get('lang'))
    ```

### Contributing Pickers

We welcome contributions via a GitHub PR so long as the picker is not overly specific to a single site.
